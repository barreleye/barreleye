## What is Barreleye?

Barreleye is an open-source **blockchain KYC** tool. It can trace the flow and amount of funds to & from risky addresses.

Features:

1. **Simple.** Easy to get started with on a single machine.
1. **Scalable.** Optimized for demanding business use-cases.
1. **Extendable.** API-based interface so it can be integrated into other systems.
1. **Multi-chain.** Supports Bitcoin and EVM-based networks (with ability to add more).

## Download

<!-- ### Via package manager (not recommended right now; outdated)

```bash
cargo install barreleye
```

### From source -->

Requires Rust 1.70.0+:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/barreleye/barreleye
cd barreleye
cargo build && cargo install
```

## Get Started

How it works:

1. Start the program
1. Barreleye will start indexing blockchains
1. Once it's done, you're able to make API requests to:
    - Manage risky entities & their addresses
    - Trace the flow & amount of funds to/from those risky addresses
    - Do risk management & compliance in a private manner

To run Barreleye locally:

```bash
./barreleye
```

This will do the following:

- Run migrations (including seeding with a random public Ethereum RPC node)
- Start the server, which will handle admin & analytics API requests
- Start the indexer, which will:
  - Store extracted blockchain data in Parquet files locally
  - Store relational data in SQLite locally
  - Store warehouse data in DuckDB locally

For production you'd probably want to store extracted blockchain data in anything S3-compatible (eg: R2, GCS, MinIO, etc):

```bash
./barreleye \
  --storage http://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/bucket_name/
# --storage http://storage.googleapis.com/bucket_name/
```

You can also use a hosted RDBMS like PostgreSQL or MySQL instead of SQLite:

```bash
./barreleye \
  --storage http://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/bucket/ \
  --database postgres://username:password@postgres-host:5432/database_name
# --database mysql://username:password@mysql-host:3306/database_name
```

And a hosted warehouse OLAP instead of DuckDB (currently only Clickhouse is supported):

```bash
./barreleye \
  --storage http://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/bucket/ \
  --database postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name \
  --warehouse http://username:password@localhost:8123/database_name
```

Finally, to speed up indexing run your own Ethereum archive node with a higher rate-limit (rps = requests per second):

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "rpcEndpoint": "$YOUR_OWN_RPC_NODE_URL",
    "rps": 1500
  }' \
  http://localhost:4000/v0/networks/net_ethereum
```

## Add Custom Networks

For now, Barreleye works with Bitcoin and EVM-compatible chains.

A default API key is generated on the first run, so to get it - connect to your RDBMS and run:

```sql
select uuid from api_keys;
```

Add a Bitcoin RPC node:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Bitcoin",
    "architecture": "bitcoin",
    "blockTime": 600000,
    "rpcEndpoint": "http://username:password@127.0.0.1:8332"
  }' \
  http://localhost:4000/v0/networks
```

Add an EVM-based RPC node:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Ethereum",
    "architecture": "evm",
    "blockTime": 12000,
    "rpcEndpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:8545"
  }' \
  http://localhost:4000/v0/networks
```

⏳ Indexing will take a while. To monitor progress:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:4000/v0/stats
```

## Analytics

To get networks, assets, labels, etc:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  http://localhost:4000/v0/info?address=$BLOCKCHAIN_ADDRESS
```

To find connected labeled addresses that might have funded the requested address through multiple hops:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  http://localhost:4000/v0/upstream?address=$BLOCKCHAIN_ADDRESS
```

## Random Notes

- Be aware of your RPC node limits. Indexer makes a significant amount of RPC calls to index historical and new blocks.
- For indexing, you might have to set Clickhouse's `max_server_memory_usage_to_ram_ratio` to `2` ([read more](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/17631))
